This repository consists mostly of MATLAB/GNU Octave scripts to help automate projects for the class and teach students how to script and make their (research/industry) lives easier!

For the second course I have added a template for HW1.

Python scripts may be coming soon...

### Physics 141/241 ###
Computational Physics I: Probabilistic Models and Simulations (4-4) Project-based computational physics laboratory course with student’s choice of Fortran90/95 or C/C++. Applications from materials science to the structure of the early universe are chosen from molecular dynamics, classical and quantum Monte Carlo methods, physical Langevin/Fokker-Planck processes, and other modern topics. Graduate students will do advanced projects. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor; graduate standing for 241. (W)

### Physics 142/242 ###
Computational Physics II: PDE and Matrix Models (4-4) Project-based computational physics laboratory course for modern physics and engineering problems with student’s choice of Fortran90/95 or C/C++. Applications of finite element PDE models are chosen from quantum mechanics and nanodevices, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, materials physics, and other modern topics. Graduate students will do advanced projects. Prerequisites: upper-division standing; graduate standing for 242. (S)
